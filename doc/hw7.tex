\section{Concurrency}
As Professor Stoller has mentioned, the project has relatively few concurrency
issues. There might be small race conditions between an administrator and a
student such as marking a decision as questionable, but these are minor. In
addition users can only edit their own profile. The only shared data that is
accessible by two or more students is High School. When a hs is not in the system, it has to
be scraped. This can happen in two cases, when a user is searching for similar
high schools, or when he or she updates his or her profile. 

The way we handle this is by using atomic transactions in get-similar-hs and
post-student-profile in views.py. We choose the appropriate transaction
boundaries and make sure the transaction is atomic, thus preventing any
concurrency issues.
